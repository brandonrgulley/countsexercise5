# I: Six Bat Species Compared

**Instead of just one species, I decided to look at all 6 that I am studying to see if the canopy is preventing the lunar cycle from affecting their foraging activity.**

```{r date, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}

bats <- read.csv("data_master.csv")

bats$time <- paste(bats$hour, bats$min, sep = ":")

bats_1 <- bats %>% 
  select_("site", "date", "time", "species", "pulses", "lum")

bats_1$datetime <- paste(bats_1$date, bats_1$time, sep = " ")

bats_1$datetime <- as.POSIXct(bats_1$datetime, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

View(bats_1)

```

# II. Graphs

**First, I built a linear graph to see what the trendline looked like. There was a downward slope to the trendline**

```{r moonphase total, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}

moonplot1 <- ggplot(bats_1, aes(x=lum, y=pulses)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=lum)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(x = "Lunar Disk Luminosity (%)", y = "Detected Bat Activity (Pulses)", title = "Bat Activity in Response to Lunar Cycle")
moonplot1

```

**Then I checked the histogram.**

```{r histogram, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}

ggplot(data=bats_1, aes(pulses)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3) + 
  labs(x="Pulses", y=NULL, title="Pulses Histogram")

```

# III. Checking the Model

**I built a model on the relationship between activity, which I quantified in the amount of pulses emitted in total, as a response to the luminosity of the lunar disk in percent. Upon checking the model it appears to suffer from overdispersion.**

```{r model1, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}

model1 <- glm(pulses ~ lum, family = poisson, data=bats_1)

summary(model1)

check_model(model1)

```

# IV: Addressing the Over-disperion

**I tried to fix this by building a quasipoisson model, but it did not fix the overdispersion problem. This supports the prediction that the lunar cycle is not affecting the foraging activity of the bats.**

```{r quasimodel, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}

model1_quasi <- glm(pulses~lum, family = quasipoisson, data = bats_1)

```

```{r quasi summary, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}

summary(model1_quasi)

```
